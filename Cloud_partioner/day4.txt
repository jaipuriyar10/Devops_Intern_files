EC2 Instance Types – Compute Optimized
• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance 
processors:
• Batch processing workloads
• Media transcoding
• High performance web servers
• High performance computing (HPC)
• Scientific modeling & machine learning
• Dedicated gaming servers

EC2 Instance Types – Memory Optimized
• Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
• Use cases: 
• High performance, relational/non-relational databases
• Distributed web scale cache stores
• In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
• Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data

EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write 
access to large data sets on local storage
• Use cases: 
• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
• Relational & NoSQL databases
• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
• Data warehousing applications
• Distributed file systems


Introduction to Security Groups
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
• Security groups only contain rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group

Security Groups
Deeper Dive 
•Security groups are acting as a “firewall” on EC2 instances 
• They regulate: • Access to Ports 
• Authorised IP ranges – IPv4 and IPv6 
• Control of inbound network (from other to the instance) 
• Control of outbound network (from the instance to othe
