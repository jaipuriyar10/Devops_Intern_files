EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud):

• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS’ offering 
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

EC2 sizing & configuration options 
• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS 
• How much compute power & cores (CPU) 
• How much random-access memory (RAM) 
• How much storage space: 
• Network-attached (EBS & EFS) 
• hardware (EC2 Instance Store) 
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address 
• Firewall rules: security group 
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data
• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script. 
• bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
• That script is only run once at the instance first start
• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
• Installing updates
• Installing software
• Downloading common files from the internet
• Anything you can think of
• The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

Hands-On:
Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
• We’ll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
• We’ll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
• We’ll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
• We’ll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

EC2 Instance Types - Overview
• You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for 
different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)
• AWS has the following naming convention:
m5.2xlarge
• m: instance class 
• 5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
• 2xlarge: size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types – General Purpose
• Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
• Balance between: 
• Compute
• Memory
• Networking
• In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2 
instance

EC2 Instance Types – Storage Optimized
• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write 
access to large data sets on local storage
• Use cases: 
• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
• Relational & NoSQL databases
• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
• Data warehousing applications
• Distributed file systems

Introduction to Security Groups
• Security Groups are the fundamental of network security in AWS
• They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
• Security groups only contain rules
• Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group.
