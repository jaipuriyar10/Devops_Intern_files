a- Introduction to Cloud Computing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
--Cloud Computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence, and more, over the Cloud (Internet).
  Cloud Computing provides an alternative to the on-premises datacentre. With an on-premises datacentre, we have to manage everything, such as purchasing and installing hardware,
  virtualization, installing the operating system, and any other required applications, setting up the network, configuring the firewall, and setting up storage for data.
  After doing all the set-up, we become responsible for maintaining it through its entire lifecycle.
  
There are three main service models of cloud computing – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).
There are clear differences between the three and what they can offer a business in terms of storage and resource pooling, 
but they can also interact with each other to form one comprehensive model of cloud computing.

IaaS (Infrastructure as Service):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the most common service model of cloud computing as it offers the fundamental infrastructure of virtual servers, network, operating systems and data storage drives.
It allows for the flexibility, reliability and scalability that many businesses seek with the cloud, and removes the need for hardware in the office. 
This makes it ideal for small and medium sized organisations looking for a cost-effective IT solution to support business growth.
IaaS is a fully outsourced pay-for-use service and is available as a public, private or hybrid infrastructure.

PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is where cloud computing providers deploy the infrastructure and software framework, but businesses can develop and run their own applications.
Web applications can be created quickly and easily via PaaS, and the service is flexible and robust enough to support them. 
PaaS solutions are scalable and ideal for business environments where multiple developers are working on a single project.
It is also handy for situations where an existing data source (such as CRM tool) needs to be leveraged.

SaaS (Software as a Service):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This cloud computing solution involves the deployment of software over the internet to variousbusinesses who pay via subscription or a pay-per-use model. 
It is a valuable tool for CRM and for applications that need a lot of web or mobile access – such as mobile sales management software.
SaaS is managed from a central location so businesses don’t have to worry about maintaining it themselves, and is ideal for short-term projects.


b- Business needs and cloud solution
  
Flexibility
~~~~~~~~~~~
In recent years, many businesses are realizing how Cloud Computing is so important to be applied to the work environment of today.
Even in a recent survey conducted by KPMG to 500 executives, it was found that 42% of them think that flexible work is the main factor why they use Cloud Computing.
It offers greater flexibility to your employees in their work practices. If you need access to your documents and data while you are off-site or at home, 
you can interface with your virtual office, quickly and effortlessly whenever you need through any web-enable devices.


Cost Savings and Investment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Perhaps, one of the most remarkable benefits of Cloud Computing is certainly considerable savings in company’s IT costs. 
You do not need to spend for the purchase of inventory such as infrastructure and hard disk. You are only charged a low cost for regular compensation per month or once paid,
according to the agreed service package with the Cloud Computing service provider. Thus, the royalty fees on automated software licenses are reduced, 
because they all run with Cloud-based computing.

Disaster Recovery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No matter the size, every business should be investing in durable disaster recovery, but for smaller businesses that lack the required budget and skills,
this is often more an ideal than the reality. Cloud is currently helping more businesses avoid that pattern. According to one study, small companies are twice as likely as
bigger companies to have implemented cloud-based backup and recovery solutions that save time, keep away from large up-front investment and roll up third-party expertise as 
part of the deal.

Collaboration Efficiency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cloud Computing model enables your business to communicate and share more easily outside of the traditional methods. It allows better collaboration between employees, 
enabling multiple users to share and work on data and files at the same time. Cloud makes it simple for the company’s design and construction experts, 
who invest much of their time on job sites overseas or across various areas, to get work related information, documents and records quickly and in a secure way.

Scalability
~~~~~~~~~~~
Another major benefit of cloud computing is its scalability. Cloud-based services are ideal for organizations with growing or fluctuating bandwidth demands. 
Your business can scale up or scale down operation and the resource storage needs of your business may need quick adjustment to suit such variations, allowing flexibility as
the needs change. If the needs increase, it’s easy to upsize your Cloud capacity, drawing on the service’s remote servers. Similarly, if you need to downsize again, 
the flexibility is baked into the service. The best way to scale up your business is using Cloud ERP. It’s easier and complete system.

c- Overview of AWS

Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools,
IoT, security, and enterprise applications: on-demand, available in seconds, with pay-as-you-go pricing. From data warehousing to deployment tools, directories to content 
delivery, over 175 AWS services are available. New services can be provisioned quickly, without the upfront capital expense. This allows enterprises, start-ups, 
small and medium-sized businesses, and customers in the public sector to access the building blocks they need to respond quickly to changing business requirements.
